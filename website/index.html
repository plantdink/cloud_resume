      <h3 class="cr-center">About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since the Commodore C64 I have had a fascination with computers and
        what makes them tick. Cloud technologies and global distributed
        computing are no longer just an idea and I genuinely enjoy working in this area. Containerisation, Orchestration, Edge computing and micro-clouds are areas I am keenly interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a creative, hard-working problem solver. I love to learn and enjoy
        applying that knowledge in a practical way to make life easier for other
        people. As a career-changer my previous experience allows me to
        offer unique insight and a highly practical perspective. Small,
        close-knit team environments that contribute to the big picture are
        where I excel. I have a proven record in designing, implementing, maintaining daily operation of and optimising cloud infrastructure. I also bring a history of high performance in the most demanding of situations and roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in pursuing suitable Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Platform Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer roles.
